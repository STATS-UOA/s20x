<h2>Apples Data</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
These data come from a classic long-term experiment conducted at the
East Malling Research Station, Kent, which is the centre four research
into apple growing in the U.K. Commercial apple trees consist of two
parts grafted together. The lowest part, the <EM>rootstock</EM>, largely
determines the size of the tree, while the upper part (the <EM>scion</EM>)
determines the fruit characteristics. Rootstocks propagated by
cuttings (i.e. asexually produced) were once thought to result in
smaller trees than those propagated from seeds (i.e. sexually
produced). This hypothesis was re-examined in an experiment begun in
1918. Several trees of each type of 16 types of rootstock were
planted, all trees having the same scion. Rootstocks I-IX were
asexually produced, while X-XVI were sexually produced. In the winter
of 1933-4 a number of trees were removed to make room for more, and
the data presented here consists of the above ground weights of 104
trees felled in this period. No trees of types VIII, XI or XIV were
felled.
