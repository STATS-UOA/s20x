\description{
Male Egyptian skulls from five different epochs. Each skull has had four
measurements taken of it, BH, Basibregmatic Height, BL, Basialveolar Length,
MB, Maximum Breadth and NH, Nasal Height. It is of interest to investigate
the change in shape over time. A gradual change, would indicate inbreeding
of the populations. This data only includes the maximum breadth
measurements.
