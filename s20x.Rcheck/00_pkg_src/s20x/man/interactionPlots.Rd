\usage{
interactionPlots(y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{either a formula of the form: y~fac1+fac2 where y is the response
and fac1 and fac2 are the two explanatory variables used as factors, or a
single response vector}

\item{fac1}{if 'y' is a vector, then fac1 contains the levels of factor 1
which correspond to the y value}

\item{fac2}{if 'y' is a vector, then fac1 contains the levels of factor 2
which correspond to the y value}

\item{data}{an optional data frame containing the variables in the model.}

\item{xlab}{an optional label for the x-axis. If not specified the name of
fac1 will be used.}

\item{xlab2}{an optional label for the lines. If not specified the name of
fac2 will be used.}

\item{ylab}{An optional label for the y-axis. If not specified the name of y
will be used.}

\item{data.order}{if TRUE the levels of fac1 and fac2 will be set to
unique(fac1) and unique(fac2) respectively.}

\item{exlim}{provide extra limits.}

\item{jitter}{the amount of horizontal jitter to show in the plot.  The
actual jitter is determined as the function is called, and will likely be
different each time the function is used.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the intervals.}

\item{interval.type}{four options for intervals appearing on plot: 'tukey',
'hsd', 'lsd' or 'ci'.}

\item{pooled}{two options: pooled or unpooled standard deviation used for
plotted intervals.}

\item{tick.length}{size of tick, in inches.}

\item{interval.distance}{distance, as a fraction of the column width,
between the points and interval.  This is in addition to the extra space
allocated for the jitter.}

\item{col.width}{width of a factor `column', as a fraction of the space
between the centres of two columns.}

\item{xlab.distance}{distance of x-axis labels from bottom of plot, as a
fraction of the overall height of the plot.}

\item{xlen, ylen}{xxx}

\item{\dots}{optional arguments.}
}
\description{
Displays data with intervals for each combination of the two factors and
shows the mean differences between levels of the first factor for each level
of the second factor. Note that there should be more than one observation
for each combination of factors.
