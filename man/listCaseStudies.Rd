\usage{
listCaseStudies()

listCS()

lcs()
}
\value{
A named character vector of case study identifiers and titles. If no case
studies are found, an empty character vector is returned.
}
\description{
Lists all case study R Markdown files shipped with the package and returns
them in numerical order, together with their titles.
}
\details{
Case studies are expected to live in \code{inst/case_studies} and to be named
using the pattern \code{CS<chapter>_<number>.Rmd} (e.g. \code{CS9_2.Rmd}).


The returned object is a named character vector. Each element has the form
\code{"CSx_y: <title>"}, and the names are the case study identifiers
(e.g. \code{"CS9_2"}).

Sorting is numerical rather than alphabetical, so for example
\code{CS17_1} appears after \code{CS9_2}.
